I am a lecturer in machine learning at the [Machine Learning Research Group](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/research/groups/machine-learning), [School of Computer Science](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/cs), and deputy head of AI research engineering at [Centre for Machine Intelligence](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/machine-intelligence), [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/).

My current research focuses on developing interpretable machine learning methods and tools for healthcare. I am a co-creator and core developer of open-source library [PyKale](https://github.com/pykale/pykale), which provides a range of accessible multimodal and transfer learning algorithms.

I serve as a reviewer for the [IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS)](https://cis.ieee.org/publications/t-neural-networks-and-learning-systems), [IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems (TCDS)](https://cis.ieee.org/publications/t-cognitive-and-developmental-systems), [IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems & Rehabilitation Engineering (TNSRE)](https://www.embs.org/tnsre/), and [Cerebral Cortex](https://academic.oup.com/cercor). Additionally, I served as a PC member for the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI) in [2022](https://ijcai-22.org/pc-members/), [2023](https://ijcai-23.org/pc-member-list), and [2024](https://ijcai24.org/program-committee-pcs), as well as for the International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) 2024 and 2025. I am also an organiser of the [Meta-Learning for Multimodal Data](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/interest-groups/meta-learning-multimodal-data) Turing interest group and a recipient of the [Post-Doctoral Enrichment Awards (PDEA) 2022 programme](https://www.turing.ac.uk/post-doctoral-enrichment-awards-pdea) from [the Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk).

<!-- I currently have one open [PhD position](https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/developing-foundation-models-for-multimodal-neuroimaging-data/?p168127) available. If you are interested, please contact me by email with: 1) your CV; 2) one representative piece of your writing (e.g., paper, dissertation, technical report); 3) code samples via an attachment or providing your GitHub page link; and 4) a description of a collaboration experience in your Application Statement. -->
