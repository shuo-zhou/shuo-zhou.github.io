I am an academic fellow in machine learning at the [Machine Learning Research Group](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/research/groups/machine-learning), [Department of Computer Science, University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/indexdcs).

My current research focuses on developing interpretable machine learning methods and tools for medical image analysis. I am a co-creator and core developer of open-source library [PyKale](https://github.com/pykale/pykale), which provides a range of accessible multi-modal and transfer learning algorithms.

I serve as a reviewer of [IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=5962385) and
[IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/aboutJournal.jsp?punumber=7274989). I also served as a PC member of [IJCAI 2022](https://ijcai-22.org/pc-members/). I am an organiser of the [Meta-Learning for Multimodal Data](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/interest-groups/meta-learning-multimodal-data) interest group and awardee of the [Post-Doctoral Enrichment Awards (PDEA) 2022 programme](https://www.turing.ac.uk/post-doctoral-enrichment-awards-pdea) of [the Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk).
